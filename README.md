## Work in progress... 
- Website [spacectl.dev](https://sleepyowl.dev/)

## I'm a SRE
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning eBPF
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to draw.

## What I genrally do as a SRE?
- Maintain High Observability and Monitoring standards for distributed systems by writing custom tools using Go-lang such that infrastructure issue vs application issue can be distinguished easily.
- Blameless postmortems to identify underlying issues and root causes whether it be lack of communication within global teams, bad config, etc.
- Actively participate in reviewing, authoring and suggesting application design with Developer teams to reach a general consensus on infrastructure demands and service deployment expectations.
